Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC)The CFTC oversees the U.S. derivatives markets, including futures contracts, options, and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. While the rules that the CFTC has oversight of were part of the Commodities Exchange Act (CEA), which was passed in 1936, the Commission itself was established in 1974 by the passage of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission Act. The mission of the CFTC is to enforce laws, rules, and regulations within the derivatives markets it oversees to help ensure that firms and individuals operating in such markets provide legally required privacy rights to their consumers and promote the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives markets through sound regulation.2. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)The FDIC provides deposit insurance of at least $250,000 for accounts with banks and thrift institutions. The FDIC aims to preserve and promote the public’s confidence in the U.S. financial system by providing deposit insurance. The FDIC is also responsible for enforcing financial data compliance as part of its mandate to ensure that banks comply with consumer data protection laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which includes data security directives.3. Federal ReserveThe Federal Reserve Banking System provides guidance on managing outsourcing risk, including data for all financial institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve. It is also responsible for supervising, monitoring, inspecting, and examining institutions’ financial data compliance to ensure that they adhere to the necessary rules and regulations, including those published by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), regarding safeguards for customer data.4. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council is a\n",
      "\n",
      "five-member U.S. government interagency body. It consists of five banking regulators and is responsible for uniformity in the guidelines and supervision of financial institutions, including financial data compliance. It includes financial data management mandates, such as directing how organizations should govern the secure storage of all types of sensitive information, whether on computer systems, physical media, or hard-copy documents.5. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) SEC Rules 17a-4The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires broker-dealers to adhere to numerous financial data compliance regulations, including SEC Rule 17a-4(f)(3)(vii), which includes strict mandates on how electronic data must be stored, how it can be accessed, and how and when the archiving process should be reviewed. Several additional U.S. drivers for financial data compliance include the following:Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank)The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010 to facilitate financial stability by augmenting transparency and accountability. Financial data compliance requirements include specific directives related to email. To adhere to Dodd-Frank financial data compliance requirements related to communication, financial organizations must take steps to preserve email communication within proscribed periods of time with redundancy and other procedures to ensure that it is protected.  Office for the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) The Office for the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is an independent bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that charters, regulates, and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations, as well as federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. As part of its charter to protect consumers, the OCC enforces federal data compliance regulations, such as FFIEC, GLBA, and the Privacy Act of 1974.Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) protects investors by ensuring the maintenance of fair, orderly, and efficient markets and facilitating capital formation. The SEC Cybersecurity Rule 2023 requires that market entities (e.g., broker-dealers, national securities exchanges) establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to address their cybersecurity risks. With regard to financial data compliance, the SEC requires any data breach that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information asset.Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)SOX focuses on how organizations disclose and record their financial information.

Five of the ones that regulators struggle to stay ahead of are:1. Constantly morphing attack strategies and vectors  2. Data privacy and security challenges   3. Employee and third-party misconduct—accidental and malicious4. Lack of corporate governance5. Loopholes that enable money laundering, insider trading, and other types of market abuseOther Standards and Frameworks to KnowAnti-Money Laundering (AML)AML prevents illegally passing obtained funds through a complex system in order to make the funds appear legitimate and legal. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) oversees government efforts to combat money laundering in the U.S. FinCEN detects, prevents, and deters money laundering and terrorist financing. Financial data compliance best practices help organizations identify suspicious activity that could indicate money laundering.  Know Your Client, Know Your Customer (KYC)KYC is a standard practice that requires financial institutions to be able to identify the client they are working with, ensure the client is who they say they are, know the client’s tolerance to risk, and be aware of the client’s financial position. Financial data compliance requires financial institutions that collect and store KYC data to ensure that customer data (e.g., biometric or non-biometric personal data) is protected and not at risk of unauthorized access or exfiltration. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)PCI DSS is a series of financial data compliance security guidelines to safeguard consumer data. It standardizes how cardholder data is processed, stored, and transmitted. These regulations are set forth by the Federal Trade Commission, which governs the distribution of private financial information.This financial data compliance regulation includes rules that require financial institutions to keep customers informed of any data-sharing practices in which they engage. PCI DSS also requires financial institutions to provide customers with educational materials explaining how they can opt out of these data-sharing practices. Data encryption and key management are key parts of PCI DSS financial data compliance.National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides recommendations for\n",

Drivers for Financial Data ComplianceWhy are Compliance Laws Important?Limitations of Compliance LawsTips for Complying with Data Security RegulationsFinancial Data Compliance Improves Overall SecurityWhat Is Financial Compliance?Financial compliance is financial institutions’ (e.g., financial services organizations, capital markets) adherence to internal and external rules set forth by governments, industry groups, and internal governance policies. Financial data compliance is a governance structure focused on data protection that ensures that an organization complies with laws, regulations, and standards around its data. Financial data compliance includes processes and security tools to govern and secure the possession, organization, storage, and management of digital assets or data to prevent loss, theft, misuse, or compromise. Different financial data compliance regulations specify the types of data that require protection and, in some cases, direct what should be done to ensure its security.The growing stringency of financial data compliance requirements also pushes organizations to rethink updating legacy security systems.Origin of Financial ComplianceThe term was first used by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS, the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks) in 2005. In its document “Compliance and the compliance function in banks,” the body defines compliance, “The expression compliance risk is defined in this paper as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or loss to reputation a bank may suffer as a result of its failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards, and codes of conduct applicable to its banking activities.”Financial data compliance helps organizations prevent legal issues and financial losses and improve overall\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mRelevant Documents: 0\n",
